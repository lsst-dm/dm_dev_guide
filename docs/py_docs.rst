#######################
Documenting Python APIs
#######################

We document Python code in three ways:

1. By writing *docstrings* for all public python objects (modules, classes, methods, functions and constants).
   
   These docstrings are exposed to users in a variety of contexts, from developers reading the code, to interactive Python users introspecting an object with ``help()``, Jupyter notebook users typing `object?`, and finally to readers of this user guide.

   Docstrings are the public specification of our Python API.

2. By commenting our code internally with hash marks (``#``).
   
   These comments are meant to be read only by developers reading and editing the source code.

3. By allowing Python objects to be introspected interactively with the ``__str__`` and ``__repr__`` magic methods.

This page focuses on public code documentation through docstrings, while the latter two are discussed in our :doc:`../coding/python_style_guide`.

Treat the guidelines on this page as an extension of the :doc:`../coding/python_style_guide`.

.. note::
   Changes to this document must be approved by the System Architect (`RFC-24 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-24>`_).
   To request changes to these standards, please file an :ref:`RFC <decision-making-rfc>`.

.. _py-docstring-basics:

Basic Format of Docstrings
==========================

Python docstrings are special strings that form the ``__doc__`` attributes attached to modules, classes, methods and functions.
Docstrings are specified by :pep:`257`.

.. _py-docstring-triple-double-quotes:

Docstrings MUST be delimited by triple double quotes
----------------------------------------------------

Docstrings **must** be delimited by triple double quotes: ``"""``.
This allows docstrings to span multiple lines.
You may use ``u"""`` for unicode but it is usually preferable to stick to ASCII.

For consistency, *do not* use triple single quotes: ``'''``.

.. _py-docstring-form:

Docstrings SHOULD begin with ``"""`` and terminate with ``"""`` on its own line
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The docstring's summary sentence occurs on the same line as the opening ``"""``.

The terminating ``"""`` should be on its own line, even for 'one-line' docstrings (this is a minor departure from :pep:`257`).
For example, a one-line docstring:

.. code-block:: py

   """Sum numbers in an array.
   """

(*Note:* one-line docstrings are rarely used for public APIs, see :ref:`py-docstring-sections`.)

An example of a multi-paragraph docstring:

.. code-block:: py

   """Sum numbers in an array.

   Parameters
   ----------
   values : iterable
      Python iterable whose values are summed.

   Returns
   -------
   sum : `float`
      Sum of `values`.
   """

.. _py-docstring-no-blanks:

Docstrings SHOULD NOT be preceded or followed by a blank line
-------------------------------------------------------------

For example:

.. code-block:: py

   def sum(values):
       """Sum numbers in an array.

       Parameters
       ----------
       values : iterable
          Python interable whose values are summed.

       Returns
       -------
       sum : `float`
          Sum of `values`.
       """
       pass

.. _py-docstring-indentation:

Docstring content MUST be indented with the code's scope
--------------------------------------------------------

For example:

.. code-block:: py

   def sum(values):
       """Sum numbers in an array.

       Parameters
       ----------
       values : iterable
          Python interable whose values are summed.
       """
       pass

Not:

.. code-block:: py

   def sum(values):
       """Sum numbers in an array.

   Parameters
   ----------
   values : iterable
      Python interable whose values are summed.
   """
       pass

.. _py-docstring-placement:

Docstring Placement
===================

.. _py-docstring-module-placement:

Modules
-------

Module-level docstrings must be placed as close to the top of the Python file as possible: *below* any ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` and license statements, but *above* imports.
See also: :ref:`style-guide-py-file-order`.

Module docstrings should not be indented.
For example:

.. code-block:: python
   
   #
   # LSST Data Management System
   # See COPYRIGHT file at the top of the source tree.
   #
   # [...]
   #
   # You should have received a copy of the LSST License Statement and
   # the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not,
   # see <http://www.lsstcorp.org/LegalNotices/>.
   #
   """Summary of MyModule.

   Extended discussion of my module.
   """

   import lsst.afw.table as afw_table
   # [...]

.. _py-docstring-class-method-function-placement:

Classes, Methods, and Functions
-------------------------------

Class/method/function docstrings must be placed directly below the declaration, and indented according to the code scope.

.. code-block:: python

   class MyClass(object):
       """Summary of MyClass.

       Additional discussion.
       """

       def __init__(self):
           pass

       def method(self):
           """Summary of method.

           Extended Discussion of my method.
           """
           pass


   def my_function():
       """Summary of my_function.

       Extended discussion of my_function.
       """
       pass

Note that the class docstring takes the place of a docstring for the ``__init__`` method; ``__init__`` has no docstring.

.. _py-docstring-rst:

ReStructuredText in Docstrings
==============================

We use reStructuredText to mark up and give semantic meaning to text in docstrings.
ReStructuredText is lightweight enough to read in raw form, such as command line terminal printouts, but is also parsed and rendered with our Sphinx-based documentation build system.
All of the style guidance for using reStructuredText from our :doc:`rst_styleguide` applies in docstrings with a few exceptions defined here.

.. _py-docstring-nospace-headers:

No space between headers and paragraphs
---------------------------------------

For docstrings, the Numpydoc_ standard is to omit any space between a header and the following paragraph.

For example

.. code-block:: python

   """A summary

   A Headline
   ----------
   A paragraph
   """

This :ref:`deviation from the normal style guide <rst-sectioning>` is in keeping with Python community idioms and to save vertical space in terminal help printouts.

.. _py-docstring-section-levels:

Top level headers are defined with '-'
--------------------------------------

In docstrings, the top level header is marked up with a ``-``, the third level listed in our :ref:`ReStructuredText Style Guide <rst-sectioning>`.
The header hierarchy is thus:

1. Sections ``-``,
2. Subsections ``^``,
3. Subsubsections ``"``.

This deviation from our :ref:`reST Style Guide <rst-sectioning>` is in keeping with NumPy community idioms, and required by our Sphinx tooling.

.. FIXME uncomment this when RFC-107 is decided
..
.. Docstring lines should be 75 characters long or less
.. ----------------------------------------------------
.. 
.. .. TODO link to code style guide
.. 
.. Our Coding Style Guide allows for Python lines to be as long as 110 lines.
.. However docstring lines *must be 75 characters or fewer* to facilitate reading in the terminal or Jupyter notebook contexts.\ [#length]_
.. 
.. .. [#length] '75' originates from the PEP8 length length recommendation of 79 characters, with the typical 4-space indentation level assumed.

.. _py-docstring-sections:

Common Structure of Docstrings
==============================

We organize Python docstrings into sections that appear in a common order.
This format follows the `Numpydoc`_ standard (used by NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy, among other scientific Python packages) rather than the format described in :pep:`287`.
The sections and their relative order is:

.. _Numpydoc: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt

1. :ref:`Short Summary <py-docstring-short-summary>`
2. :ref:`Deprecation Warning <py-docstring-deprecation>` (if applicable)
3. :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` (optional)
4. :ref:`Parameters <py-docstring-parameters>` (if applicable; for classes, methods, and functions)
5. :ref:`Methods <py-docstring-methods>` (if applicable; for classes)
6. :ref:`Attributes <py-docstring-attributes>` (if applicable; for classes)
7. :ref:`Returns <py-docstring-returns>` or :ref:`Yields <py-docstring-yields>` (if applicable; for functions, methods, and generators)
8. :ref:`Other Parameters <py-docstring-other-parameters>` (if applicable; for classes, methods, and functions)
9. :ref:`Raises <py-docstring-raises>` (if applicable)
10. :ref:`See Also <py-docstring-see-also>` (optional)
11. :ref:`Notes <py-docstring-notes>` (optional)
12. :ref:`References <py-docstring-references>` (optional)
13. :ref:`Examples <py-docstring-examples>` (optional)

For summaries of how these docstring sections are composed in specific contexts, see:

- :ref:`py-docstring-module-structure`
- :ref:`py-docstring-class-structure`
- :ref:`py-docstring-method-function-structure`
- :ref:`py-docstring-attribute-constants-structure`

.. _py-docstring-short-summary:

Short Summary
-------------

A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the function's name:

.. code-block:: python

   def add(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers.
       """
       return a + b

For functions and methods, the summary should be written in the imperative voice (i.e., as a command that the API consumer is giving).

.. _py-docstring-deprecation:

Deprecation Warning
-------------------

A section (where applicable) to warn users that the object is deprecated.
Section contents should include:

1. In what stack version the object was deprecated, and when it will be removed.
2. Reason for deprecation if this is useful information (e.g., object is superseded, duplicates functionality found elsewhere, etc.).
3. New recommended way of obtaining the same functionality.

This section should use the ``note`` Sphinx directive instead of an underlined section header.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. note:: Deprecated in 11_0
             `ndobj_old` will be removed in 12_0, it is replaced by
             `ndobj_new` because the latter works also with array subclasses.

.. _py-docstring-extended-summary:

Extended Summary
----------------

A few sentences giving an extended description.
This section should be used to clarify *functionality*, not to discuss implementation detail or background theory, which should rather be explored in the :ref:`'Notes' <py-docstring-notes>` section below.
You may refer to the parameters and the function name, but parameter descriptions still belong in the :ref:`'Parameters' <py-docstring-parameters>` section.

.. _py-docstring-parameters:

Parameters
----------

*For functions, methods and classes.*

'Parameters' is a description of a function or method's arguments and their respective types.

.. code-block:: rst

   Parameters
   ----------
   x : type
       Description of parameter `x`.

Notice that the description is **indented by four spaces** from the prior ``{name} : {type}`` line of each argument.
If a description spans more than one line, the continuation lines must be indented to the same level.

Arguments should be listed in the same order as they appear in the function or method signature.

.. _py-docstring-parameter-types:

Parameter Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Be as precise as possible when describing types for parameters.
The type description is free-form text, making it possible to list several supported types or indicate nuances.
Complex and lengthy descriptions can be moved to the *description* field.

.. code-block:: rst

   Parameters
   ----------
   filename : `str`
       Description of `filename`.
   copy : `bool`
       Description of `copy`.
   dtype : data-type
       Description of `dtype`.
   iterable : iterable object
       Description of `iterable`.
   shape : `int` or `tuple` of int
       Description of `shape`.
   files : `list` of `str`
       Description of `files`.

Note that concrete types are wrapped in backticks, which is the *default role* in reStructuredText.
When possible, Sphinx will make a link to the API reference for that object using `intersphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/intersphinx.html>`_.
(In docstrings, ``:py:obj:`` is the :ref:`default role <rst-python-link>`.)

For instances of classes, provide the full namespace to the class, such as ```lsst.afw.table.ExposureTable```.

When a parameter can only assume one of a fixed set of values, those values can be listed in braces:

.. code-block:: rst

   order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}
       Description of `order`.

.. _py-docstring-optional:

Optional Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For keyword arguments, add 'optional' to the type specification:

.. code-block:: rst

   x : `int`, optional

Optional keyword parameters have default values, which are automatically documented as part of the function or method's signature.
Default values can also be detailed in the description:

.. code-block:: rst

   Parameters
   ----------
   x : `int`, optional
       Description of parameter `x` (the default is -1, which implies summation
       over all axes).

.. _py-docstring-shorthand:

Shorthand
^^^^^^^^^

When two or more consecutive input parameters have exactly the same type, shape and description, they can be combined:

.. code-block:: rst

   x1, x2 : array-like
       Input arrays, description of `x1`, `x2`.

.. _py-docstring-methods:

Methods
-------

*For classes.*

If a class has a very large number of methods, which are hard to discover, an additional 'Methods' section *can* be provided to list them:

.. code-block:: rst

   Methods
   -------
   read(filename)
      Read a table from a file
   sort(column, order='ascending')
      Sort by `column`

Do not list private methods in the 'Methods' section.
If it is necessary to explain a private method (use with care!), it can be mentioned in the :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` or :ref:`Notes <py-docstring-notes>` sections.

Do not list ``self`` as the first parameter of a method.

.. _py-docstring-attributes:

Attributes
----------

*For classes.*

An 'Attributes' section, located below the 'Parameters' section, may be used to describe class variables:

.. code-block:: rst

   Attributes
   ----------
   x : `float`
       The X coordinate.
   y : `float`
       The Y coordinate.

Attributes that are properties and have their :ref:`own docstrings <py-docstring-attribute-constants-structure>` can be simply listed by name:

.. code-block:: rst

   Attributes
   ----------
   real
   imag
   x : `float`
       The X coordinate
   y : `float`
       The Y coordinate

.. _py-docstring-returns:

Returns
-------

*For functions and methods*.

'Returns' is an explanation of the returned values and their types, in the same format as :ref:`'Parameters' <py-docstring-parameters>`.

If a sequence of values is returned, each value may be separately listed, in order:

.. code-block:: rst

   Returns
   -------
   x : `int`
       Description of x.
   y : `int`
       Description of y.

If a return type is `dict`, ensure that the key-value pairs are documented in the description.

.. _py-docstring-yields:

Yields
------

*For generators.*

'Yields' is used identically to :ref:`'Returns' <py-docstring-yields>`, but for generators.

.. _py-docstring-other-parameters:

Other Parameters
----------------

*For classes, methods and functions.*

'Other Parameters' is an optional section used to describe infrequently used parameters.
It should only be used if a function has a large number of keyword parameters, to prevent cluttering the :ref:`Parameters <py-docstring-parameters>` section.

.. _py-docstring-raises:

Raises
------

*For classes, methods and functions.*

'Raises' is an optional section detailing which errors get raised and under what conditions:

.. code-block:: rst

   Raises
   ------
   `IOError`
       If the file could not be read.

This section should be used judiciously---only for errors that are non-obvious or have a large chance of getting raised.

.. _py-docstring-see-also:

See Also
--------

'See Also' is an optional section used to refer to related code.
This section can be very useful, but should be used judiciously.
The goal is to direct users to other functions they may not be aware of, or have easy means of discovering (by looking at the module docstring, for example).
Routines whose docstrings further explain parameters used by this function are good candidates.

As an example, for a function such as ``numpy.cos``, we would have

.. code-block:: rst

   See Also
   --------
   `sin` : Compute an element-wise Sine function.
   `tan` : Compute an element-wise Tangent function.

When referring to functions in the same sub-module, no prefix is needed, and the tree is searched upwards for a match.

Prefix objects from other sub-modules appropriately by their greatest common namespace.
E.g., whilst documenting a ``lsst.afw.tables`` module, refer to a class in ``lsst.afw.detection`` by

.. code-block:: rst

   `afw.detection.Footprint` : Regular detection footprint.

When referring to an entirely different module or package, use the full namespace.

.. code-block:: rst

   `astropy.table.Tables` : Flexible table data structures

Functions may be listed without descriptions; this is preferable if the functionality is clear from the function name:

.. code-block:: rst

   See Also
   --------
   `func_a` : Function a with its description.
   `func_b`, `func_c`, `func_d`
   `func_e`
   
.. _py-docstring-notes:

Notes
-----

*Notes* is an optional section that provides additional information about the code, possibly including a discussion of the algorithm.
This section may include mathematical equations, written in `LaTeX <http://www.latex-project.org/>`_ format:

.. code-block:: rst

  The FFT is a fast implementation of the discrete Fourier transform:

  .. math:: X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}

Longer equations can also be typeset underneath the math directive:

.. code-block:: rst

  The discrete-time Fourier time-convolution property states that

  .. math::

     x(n) * y(n) \Leftrightarrow X(e^{j\omega } )Y(e^{j\omega } )\\
     another equation here

Math can also be used inline:

.. code-block:: rst

   The value of :math:`\omega` is larger than 5.

Variable names are displayed in typewriter font, obtained by using ``\mathtt{var}``:

.. code-block:: rst

   We square the input parameter `alpha` to obtain
   :math:`\mathtt{alpha}^2`.

See :ref:`rst-math` for more details on math typesetting in reStructuredText.

Note that LaTeX is not particularly easy to read, so use equations sparingly.

Images are allowed, but should not be central to the explanation; users viewing the docstring as text must be able to comprehend its meaning without resorting to an image viewer.
These additional illustrations are included using:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. image:: filename

where filename is a path relative to the reference guide source directory.

.. _py-docstring-references:

References
----------

References cited in the :ref:`'Notes' <py-docstring-notes>` section may be listed here, e.g. if you cited the article below using the text ``[1]_``, include it as in the list as follows:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. [1] O. McNoleg, "The integration of GIS, remote sensing,
      expert systems and adaptive co-kriging for environmental habitat
      modelling of the Highland Haggis using object-oriented, fuzzy-logic
      and neural-network techniques," Computers & Geosciences, vol. 22,
      pp. 585-588, 1996.

Note that Web pages should be referenced with regular inline links.

References are meant to augment the docstring, but should not be required to understand it.
References are numbered, starting from one, in the order in which they are cited.

We may support `bibtex-based references instead <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex>`__ instead of explicitly writing bibliographies in docstrings.

.. _py-docstring-examples:

Examples
--------

'Examples' is an optional section for examples, using the `doctest <http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html>`_ format.
These examples do not replace unit tests, but *are* intended to be tested to ensure documentation and code is consistent.
While optional, this section is very strongly encouraged.

When multiple examples are provided, they should be separated by blank lines.
Comments explaining the examples should have blank lines both above and below them:

.. code-block:: rst

   >>> np.add(1, 2)
   3

   Comment explaining the second example

   >>> np.add([1, 2], [3, 4])
   array([4, 6])

For tests with a result that is random or platform-dependent, mark the output as such:

.. code-block:: rst

   >>> np.random.rand(2)
   array([ 0.35773152,  0.38568979])  #random

It is not necessary to use the doctest markup ``<BLANKLINE>`` to indicate empty lines in the output.

.. The examples may assume that ``import numpy as np`` is executed before the example code.

.. _py-docstring-module-structure:

Documenting Modules
===================

Module docstrings are placed *after* the boilerplate and before any imports or other code.
Module docstrings contain the following sections:

1. :ref:`Short Summary <py-docstring-short-summary>`
2. :ref:`Deprecation Warning <py-docstring-deprecation>` (if applicable)
3. :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` (optional)
4. :ref:`See Also <py-docstring-see-also>` (optional)

.. TODO Provide an example

.. _py-docstring-class-structure:

Documenting Classes
===================

Class docstrings are placed directly after the class definition, and serve to document both the class as a whole, *and* the arguments passed to the ``__init__`` constructor.
Class docstrings contain the following sections:

1. :ref:`Short Summary <py-docstring-short-summary>`
2. :ref:`Deprecation Warning <py-docstring-deprecation>` (if applicable)
3. :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` (optional)
4. :ref:`Parameters <py-docstring-parameters>` (if applicable)
5. :ref:`Methods <py-docstring-methods>` (if applicable)
6. :ref:`Attributes <py-docstring-attributes>` (if applicable)
7. :ref:`Other Parameters <py-docstring-other-parameters>` (if applicable)
8. :ref:`Raises <py-docstring-raises>` (if applicable)
9. :ref:`See Also <py-docstring-see-also>` (optional)
10. :ref:`Notes <py-docstring-notes>` (optional)
11. :ref:`References <py-docstring-references>` (optional)
12. :ref:`Examples <py-docstring-examples>` (optional)

Note that the `Methods <py-docstring-methods>`_ section is only used if the method list is extremely long.
In general, trust that the tables of contents in the user guide pages will provide useful summaries of a class's methods.

.. code-block:: python

   class SkyCoordinate(object):
       """Coordinate on the sky as Right Ascension and Declination.

       Parameters
       ----------
       ra : float
          Right ascension (degrees).
       dec : float
          Declination (degrees).
       frame : {'icrs', 'fk5'}, optional
          Coordinate frame.

       Raises
       ------
       `ValueError` : Input angles are outside range.
       
       See also
       --------
       `GalacticCoordinate`

       Examples
       --------
       To define the coordinate of the M31 galaxy,

       >>> m31_coord = SkyCoordinate(10.683333333, 41.269166667)
       SkyCoordinate(10.683333333, 41.269166667, frame='icrs')
       """

       def __init__(self, ra, dec, frame='icrs'):
           pass

.. _py-docstring-method-function-structure:

Documenting Methods and Functions
=================================

Method and function docstrings contain the following sections:

1. :ref:`Short Summary <py-docstring-short-summary>`
2. :ref:`Deprecation Warning <py-docstring-deprecation>` (if applicable)
3. :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` (optional)
4. :ref:`Parameters <py-docstring-parameters>` (if applicable)
5. :ref:`Returns <py-docstring-returns>` or `Yields <py-docstring-yields>` (if applicable)
6. :ref:`Other Parameters <py-docstring-other-parameters>` (if applicable)
7. :ref:`Raises <py-docstring-raises>` (if applicable)
8. :ref:`See Also <py-docstring-see-also>` (optional)
9. :ref:`Notes <py-docstring-notes>` (optional)
10. :ref:`References <py-docstring-references>` (optional)
11. :ref:`Examples <py-docstring-examples>` (optional)

A minimal example:

.. code-block:: python

   def log(message, level):
       """Submit a message to the log.

       Parameters
       ----------
       message : `str`
          Log message.
       level : `str`
          Priority level of the log message.
       """

.. _py-docstring-attribute-constants-structure:

Documenting Constants, Class Properties, and Attributes
=======================================================

Constants in modules, and properties and attributes in classes are all similar in that their values are accessed with arguments.
At minimum, constants/properties/attributes should have a summary line, but can also have a more complete structure with sections:

1. :ref:`Short Summary <py-docstring-short-summary>`
2. :ref:`Deprecation Warning <py-docstring-deprecation>` (if applicable)
3. :ref:`Extended Summary <py-docstring-extended-summary>` (optional)
4. :ref:`Notes <py-docstring-notes>` (optional)
5. :ref:`References <py-docstring-references>` (optional)
6. :ref:`Examples <py-docstring-examples>` (optional)

In the short summary, a description of the type should be included:

.. code-block:: rst

   NAME = 'LSST'
   """Name of the project (str)"""

Note that class attributes can alternatively be documented in an :ref:`Attributes <py-docstring-attributes>` section of the class's docstring.
This is particularly useful when the attribute is not set in the class scope, but rather in a method such as ``__init__``.

.. code-block:: rst

   class Answer(object):
       """Container for the answer.
