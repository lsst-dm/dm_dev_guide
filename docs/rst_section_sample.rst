Page Title
##########

Titles have hash marks above and below.
 
By convention, titles and section headings are set off from surrounding text by
a single blank line above and below. All levels of section headings may have
named labels, which appear before the heading. We encourage you to add labels
to all sections so that they can be referenced. Names are global, so be
specific. See :ref:`Internal Links to Labels <rst-internal-links>` for
more information. The following section heading has a label named
"``section-headings-example-section``".

.. _section-headings-example-section:

Section Heading
===============

Section headers are set with an underline. The sequence of underline characters
used (``=``, then ``-``, then ``^`` and finally ``"``) indicates the section
hierarchy.

Sections in Python docstrings are a special case. We do not put a blank space
between a headline and object lists below, and we do not add explicit section
labels. See the :doc:`docstring style guide <py_docs>` for more information.
