Meeting Free Weeks
##################

DM will observe  several **Meeting Free Weeks** each year. 


Meeting Free Weeks 2025
=======================
In 2025 meeting free weeks will be: 
   - April 14 - 18 
   - June 23 - 27  (EAS) 
   - Sept 15 - 19
   - Dec 22 - Jan 2.


Guidelines
==========
The driver for meeting free weeks is similar to :doc:`focus-friday`. 
We wish to allow staff a block of time without meetings such they can focus on a specific task or take personal time.  
These periods do not stipulate the more stringent Slack rules that :doc:`focus-friday` does. 
Basically in a meeting free week there will be none of the regular meetings. Topic specific meetings may be held as agreed by all parties.

Feedback
========
A long focus period over the end of year holidays did not go so well and two weeks was preferred. In 2023 we should include a March focus week.
There may be more refinements needed to get this correct. 
Feedback on the form and format is welcome and may be sent to your T/CAM or 
directly to William O'Mullane.
