#################################
Adding a New Package to the Build
#################################

New packages intended for distribution to end users should generally be added as a dependency of a "top-level product:" these are the roots of the LSST package hierarchy.
They include ``lsst_apps``, ``lsst_distrib``, ``qserv_distrib`` and ``lsst_sims``.

Before adding a new dependency to any of these products, it must be approved through the :doc:`RFC process </processes/decision_process>`.
Consensus must be reached regarding both the name and the suitability of the new package.
Before adopting the RFC, the following steps must be completed:

* Implementation tickets are created to cover package creation.
* The package is migrated to the ``lsst`` org, if not already there.
* An audit is done of any dependencies with a focus on identifying implied dependencies.

Packages that will not be distributed as part of a release do not require an RFC.

After approval, code written internally by Data Management should be packaged following the template in the `lsst/templates`_ repository.
DM packaging of third party code should proceed as described in :doc:`packaging-third-party-eups-dependencies`.

New packages must be added to the `LSST organization on GitHub`_ and access must be granted to appropriate teams. For DM-written code, these include "Data Management" and "Overlords."
For third-party code, either forked or packaged as "TaP" tarball-and-patch, use the "DM Externals" and "Overlords" (but *not* "Data Management") teams.
Note that the "DM Auxilliaries" [sic] team is used to mark packages that are *not* part of the release distribution; it is used to tag them alongside the release as well as to catch accidental inclusions.

.. warning::

  Failing to assign a team will break the daily and weekly builds.
  The automated builds use the team membership to determine the type of tag to be applied.
  Having the code reside in the ``lsst`` or ``lsst-dm`` organization on GitHub is not sufficient.

The new package must be added to the `etc/repos.yaml file in the lsst/repos repository`_ along with its corresponding GitHub URL.
This file is governed by a "self-merge" policy: upon opening a pull request, it will be checked by GitHub Actions, and developers may merge without further review on success.
This change **must** be merged before the package can be built on Jenkins.
Refer to :jira:`RFC-75` for background.

The new package then needs to be added to the :file:`ups/*.table` file (and possibly the :file:`ups/*.cfg` file if this is a C++ package) of one or more other packages in the stack where it is used so that the build system can work out the correct dependency tree.
Table files should use ``setupRequired(package_name)`` or ``setupOptional(package_name)`` as necessary; test data packages are usually optional to allow releases to be made without requiring large additional data packages to be included.
Packages that use optional dependencies must be written to ensure that they can pass their unit tests when the package is not available.

The new package may be added to the :file:`ups/pipelines_lsst_io.table` file in `lsst/pipelines_lsst_io`_ repository so that its documentation is built as HTML pages and made available at https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/daily.

.. _github-repository-configuration:

Configuring GitHub Repositories
===============================

All LSST DM repositories on GitHub must be configured to protect the ``master`` branch and to ensure that the merge button for pull requests can not be pushed without the branch being up to date with ``master``.
There are a number of settings required to ensure this and they are described below with URLs referring to the ``afw`` package.
Replace ``afw`` with the relevant package name to get to the correct page on GitHub.

1. On the main settings page for the repository, https://github.com/lsst/afw/settings, disable squash and rebase merging:

.. image:: /_static/build-ci/github_merge_button_settings.png

2. Configure ``master`` branch to enable protections.
For ``afw`` this is located at https://github.com/lsst/afw/settings/branches/ and can also be found from the "Branches" sidebar item on the settings screen.
In the "Branch protection rules" section of that page you will have to click on "Add rule" to create a rule for ``master``.
Add in ``master`` as the branch name pattern and then enable status checks and require that branches be up to date before merging.
Administrators must be included in these protections since it's all too easy to make a mistake without realizing you have special override powers.
With checks enabled people will be able to use the GitHub merge button on Pull Requests and know that the :ref:`standard process <workflow-code-review-merge>` is being adhered to.

.. image:: /_static/build-ci/github_branch_protection.png

In the image above no automated status checks are being performed because we have not yet enabled any.
GitHub requires that at least one check runs before the up-to-date checks are enabled so a GitHub Action or Travis job **must** be provided if the GitHub merge button is to be used.
GitHub Actions or Travis do not replace normal testing done with a :doc:`Jenkins job <jenkins-stack-os-matrix>`.
For packages that contain Python, it is useful to add a simple GitHub Action by selecting "Actions" from the GitHub repository page, selecting "New Workflow" if necessary, and choosing the "LSST DM Python lint Workflow".
If Python typing is used, it can be checked using ``mypy`` via the "LSST DM Python mypy Workflow".
Similarly, YAML files can be checked via the "LSST DM YAML lint Workflow", and shell scripts can be checked via the "LSST DM shellcheck Workflow".
(Both of those checks can be configured, either via an external file such as ``.yamllint.yaml`` or via modifications to the workflow as described in the link in the shellcheck workflow.)
If nothing seems appropriate the "LSST DM null Workflow" should be enabled to allow GitHub to do the checks it needs.

Pull requests will automatically run the GitHub Actions and their results will be visible in the "Checks" tab of the pull request on GitHub.

When the first job completes you can return to the branches settings page on GitHub.
Now you will see that the ``master`` branch is listed along with an EDIT button.
The branch protection rules will now list the GitHub Actions checks in the "up to date before merging" section.
Enable these and save.
Your branch protections screen should then look something like this:

.. _lfs-repos:

Handling Git LFS-backed repos
=============================

New :doc:`Git LFS-backed </git/git-lfs>` repos (or existing repos being converted to LFS) require additional configuration.

- The `repos.yaml`_ entry must declare that the repository is LFS backed:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      afwdata:
        url: https://github.com/lsst/afwdata.git
        lfs: true

  See the comment block at the top of `repos.yaml`_ for additional details.

- At present, the EUPS distrib packaging mechanism does not support LFS-backed repos.
  These products **must not** be added to any top-level meta-package or as a mandatory (non-``optional``) recursive dependency of a top-level package.

- *Optional* dependencies must be added to `manifest.remap`_ to prevent the creation of broken EUPS distrib packages.
  Please note that the "self-merge" policy (:jira:`RFC-75`) does not apply to `manifest.remap`_.

  Unlike changes merged into `repos.yaml`_, modifications to `manifest.remap`_ do not take immediate affect.

  We recommend that you attach the modification PR to a DM Jira issue on the ``Continuous Integration`` component.


.. warning::

   LFS-backed repositories must **always** be used as optional dependencies and must always be added to the `manifest.remap`_ file.
   This is required because of constraints imposed by the EUPS publication mechanism.
