###########################################
Building the pipelines.lsst.io site locally
###########################################

You can build the full `pipelines.lsst.io`_ site on your own computer.
Although this is slightly more complicated than :doc:`building documentation for a single package <building-single-package-docs>`, it’s the best way to ensure that cross-package links work properly.

Alternatively, you can also build and publish a development version of `pipelines.lsst.io`_ with the `sqre/infrastructure/documenteer`_ Jenkins CI job.
That Jenkins job only accepts development branches of the `pipelines_lsst_io`_ repository --- not development branches of packages.
The method described on this page is currently the only way to build documentation for development branches of packages with the full LSST Science Pipelines stack.

.. _local-pipelines-lsst-io-build-prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

Before starting, you’ll need a working ``lsst_distrib`` installation.

This installation needs to be a recent daily or weekly build so that any in-development packages will compile with the Stack. Working from the tip of the ``main`` branch is the norm for LSST software development.

The documentation build uses Documenteer_ and related Sphinx_ documentation packages, which are already installed if you are using the Rubin Conda developer environment.
You can check if ``rubin-env-developer`` is installed by running ``mamba list rubin-env``.
If not, you can install the developer environment with: ``mamba install rubin-env-developer``.

.. _local-pipelines-lsst-io-build-clone:

Clone and set up the pipelines\_lsst\_io repository
===================================================

`pipelines_lsst_io`_ is the main documentation repository for the `pipelines.lsst.io`_ site.
It contains project-wide content, like installation guides and release notes, and also provides the structure for gathering documentation content from individual packages in the LSST Science Pipelines package stack.

Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst/pipelines_lsst_io

Then set up the `pipelines_lsst_io`_ package with EUPS:

.. code:: bash

   setup -k -r pipelines_lsst_io

.. _local-pipelines-lsst-io-build-build:

Building the pipelines\_lsst\_io site
=====================================

From the :file:`pipelines_lsst_io` directory, use the `stack-docs command-line app`_ from Documenteer_ to build the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   stack-docs build

The built site is located in the :file:`_build/html` directory.

.. _local-pipelines-lsst-io-build-clean:

Cleaning up built documentation
===============================

You can clean up the built documentation and intermediate artifacts by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   stack-docs clean

Cleaning up the build is useful if you need to force a rebuild of the documentation either because a previous build failed, or a docstring changed.
Sphinx does not automatically invalidate its cache when docstrings change.

.. _local-pipelines-lsst-io-build-package-setup:

Adding a locally-developed package to the pipelines_lsst\_io build
==================================================================

The `pipelines_lsst_io`_ build works by symlinking the :doc:`doc/ directory <layout-of-doc-directory>` contents of packages that are set up by EUPS.
This means that by setting up a package, you can add it to your local `pipelines_lsst_io`_ build.

For this tutorial, you’ll use the `pipe_base`_ package as an example.

First, move out of the :file:`pipelines_lsst_io` directory and clone `pipe_base`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/lsst/pipe_base

Then set up and compile `pipe_base`_, while keeping other packages set up (the ``-k`` option):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd pipe_base
   setup -k -r .
   scons

Then clean and build the `pipelines_lsst_io`_ documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   stack-docs -d ../pipelines_lsst_io clean
   stack-docs -d ../pipelines_lsst_io build
