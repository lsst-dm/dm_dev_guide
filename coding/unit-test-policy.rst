Introduction
============

Unit testing validates the implementation of all objects from the lowest level
defined in the detailed design (classes and functions) up to and including the
lowest level in the architectural design (equivalent to the WBS components).
The next layer of testing, known as integration testing, tests the interfaces
between the architectural design objects (i.e. WBS components). This Policy
only addresses Unit Testing. Refer to `Introduction into testing or why testing
is worth the effort`_ (John R. Phillips, 2006) for a short, but good discussion
on Unit Testing and its transition into Integration Testing.

Types of Unit Tests
===================

Unit tests should be developed from the detailed design of the baseline, i.e.
from either the structure diagrams or the class/function definitions. The type
of tests performed during unit testing include:

White-box Tests
    These tests are designed by examining the internal logic of each module
    and defining the input data sets that force the execution of different
    paths through the logic. Each input data set is a test case.

Black-box Tests
    These tests are designed by examining the specification of each module and
    defining input data sets that will result in different behavior (e.g.
    outputs). Black-box tests should be designed to exercise the software for
    its whole range of inputs. Each input data set is a test case.

Performance Tests
    If the detailed design placed resource constraints on the performance of a
    module, compliance with these constraints should be tested. Each input
    data set is a test case.

The collection of a module's white-box, black-box, and performance tests is
known as a Unit Test suite. A rough measure of a Unit Test suite's quality is
the percentage of the module's code which is exercised when the test suite is
executed.

Responsibility for Implementation
=================================

Due to the nature of white box testing, it is best if the original developer
of an object creates the test suite validating that object. During later
object modification, the current developer should update the test suite to
validate the changed internals.

.. important::

   LSST DM developers are responsible for creating test suites to unit test all
   objects they implement. Additionally, they are responsible for updating an
   object's test suite after modifying the object's source code.

The division of responsibility between DM developer groups is highlighted in
the :ref:`diagram below <fig-test-development-responsibility>`. In essence,
the Science Pipelines group, which is responsible for all science algorithm
development, also develops the unit testers for: algorithm components, a Task
wrapped algorithm, and the sequences of Task wrapped algorithms comprising an
algorithmic pipeline (i.e. without parallel processing job
management). The Middleware group, so named because it is responsible for all
low level framework software, develops the unit testers for those framework
modules. Finally, the Science Validation team is responsible for the highest level test plans for
integration, system performance, and acceptance testing.

Testing Frameworks
==================

Test suite execution should be managed by a testing framework, also known as a
test harness, which monitors the execution status of individual test cases.

C++: boost.test
    LSST DM developers should use the `shared-library variant`_ of the `Boost Unit
    Test Framework`_. When unit testing C++ private functions using the Boost
    util test macros, refer to the standard methods described in :doc:`private
    function testing </cpp/testing-private-functions>`.
    
    However, C++ code that is made available to Python via simple :doc:`wrappers </pybind11/how-to>` should be tested via Python as below.
    If the wrappers are complex, which should be rare, the underlying functionality should be tested from C++.

Python: unittest
    LSST DM developers should use the Python :mod:`unittest` framework.
    Details on particular conventions to use for LSST DM code are :doc:`described later </python/testing>`.

Unit Testing Composite Objects
==============================

Data Management uses a bottom-up testing method where validated objects are
tested with, then added to, a validated baseline. That baseline, in turn, is
used as the new validated baseline for further iterative testing. When
developing test suites for composite objects, the developer should first
ensure that adequate test suites exist for the base objects.

Automated Nightly and On-Demand Testing
=======================================

`Jenkins`_ is a system which automates the compile/load/test cycle required to
validate code changes. In particular, Jenkins automatically performs unit
builds and unit tests expedites the module's repair and, hopefully, limits the
time other developers are impacted by the failure. For details, refer to the
workflow documentation on :ref:`workflow-testing`.

Verifying Test Quality
======================

Since Unit Tests are used to validate the implementation of detailed design
objects through comprehensive testing, it's important to measure the
thoroughness of the test suite. Coverage analysis does this by executing an
instrumented code which records the complete execution path through the code
and then calculating metrics indicative of the coverage achieved during
execution.

See :doc:`/stack/unit-test-coverage` for more information.
